2) The current CRF model is built for E. coli, therefore, some genes from other bacteria may not be suitable for analysis and need to be deleted for the analyze_empirical_features.py to run.

I have prepared the gene_files for all four bacteria. Due to the folder/file size limit of the GitHub, I have zipped the gene_files folder as gene_files.zip for each bacterium. If you use my 
prepared gene_files, you may need to unzip it first. Thank you!
